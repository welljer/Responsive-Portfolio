      <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>We are still in the habit of calling ourself new to Utah, we moved here from Ohio about five years ago. We have been adventuring around the state ever since then, be it rock hounding out in the western desert, hiking to see petroglyphs, or mountain biking around the Wasatch Nation Forest.</p>
          <p>We also dabble in art forms such as ink drawlings, origami, and dancing with poi. We appricate these forms due to the amount of detail that one has to have to excel at these art forms.</p>
          <p>We have worked in the Customer Service Industry from the retail perspective across several departments. In to manufacturing in the auto industry. To more recently back end billing</p>
          <p>We got interested in web development due to the unique concept of using design languages to speak with web pages and having them interact with us and other users. This concept and the direction that the markets continue to head make sense to move into this field and combine my liking of the arts with the desire to constantly push myself.</p>
